## About

Open source resources for building real-time event-driven services and data pipelines on Kubernetes.

There is a rich ecosystem of open source projects providing event-driven and real-time data infrastructure, including Apache Kafka, Flink, Spark, Pulsar, and many more. 
Navigating this ecosystem is often difficult, and knowing how to deploy, run, and combine these projects can be daunting.

The goal of StreamsHub is to provide a curated set of projects, templates, tools, and documentation to help infrastructure engineers build services that support event-driven architectures (EDA) on Kubernetes. 
Where a gap exists in the current open source offering, StreamsHub aims to host a project to fill it, with the goal of contributing solutions upstream where appropriate.

## Key Projects

- **[Console](https://github.com/streamshub/console)** -- A web UI for managing Strimzi-managed Apache Kafka clusters on Kubernetes.
- **[Flink SQL Runner](https://github.com/streamshub/flink-sql)** -- A wrapper for deploying Flink SQL jobs using the Flink Kubernetes Operator.
- **[Flink SQL Examples](https://github.com/streamshub/flink-sql-examples)** -- Tutorials for running Flink SQL on Kubernetes.

## Get Involved

### Community Slack

The main way to interact officially with the StreamsHub community is via the Proposals repository and Issues/PRs on the relevant project repositories. However, there is a community Slack workspace for more free-form conversations:
